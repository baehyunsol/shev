# 7. mouse-GUI

1. click an entry in entries to move cursor
2. toggle wide_side_bar with mouse
3. scroll the entries with the scroll bar in the wide_side_bar

# 6. reload entries

I want an operation that 1) creates `entries_map` from scratch, 2) reset `RenderCache`, but 3) doesn't update `state`.

# 3. portrait UI

landscape is 1080x720, how about 720x1080?

Then, we need 4 layouts: landscape/portrait, wide_side_bar/narrow_side_bar

# 1. auto line breaks in `text_box`
